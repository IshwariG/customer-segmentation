# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering 🧠

This project demonstrates how K-Means Clustering can be used to segment customers based on their behavioral data. It uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to group customers into different clusters for targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 📊 Objective

To segment customers into distinct groups based on features such as:
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Age
- Gender

This segmentation helps businesses better understand their customer base and tailor their services accordingly.

## 📈 Key Steps

1. Load and explore the customer dataset
2. Visualize customer patterns using scatter plots
3. Apply K-Means clustering and find the optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method)
4. Visualize clusters using different features
5. Interpret customer segments
